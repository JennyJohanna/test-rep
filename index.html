    <p>This website is about my cat friend Mirri who lives with me. 
        Mirri is a cat of the breeds Mainecoon (75%) and Persian (25%). 
        She has white fur and the cutest, smallest, pink nose. Her eyes have different colors, 
        one blue and one yellow. She was born in 2017 and is now at an age when she (me) probably longs for 
        cute baby kittens to take care of.
        So....she has been mated with a handsome Ragdoll, and is expecting cubs at any moment. 
        It is so exciting and must of course be documented here.
        Cats on the internet are a popular phenomenon. Funny cat videos, cute kittens..
        ..watching cats in general are according to research good for one's well-being. 
        Since I am interested in health and also a little bit of a crazy cat lady, 
        I want to share Mirri's wonderful cat life with you. 
        So enjoy!

    <h4>Mirri's kittens</h4>
    <p>
        Mirri is a small cat and it is not until now at the end of her pregnancy
        that you can see that she actually has babies there under her long beautiful white fur.</p>
