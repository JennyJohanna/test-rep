    <p>Hello world</p>
    <h4>JennyJohanna & Mirri</h4>

    <small>january 2021</small>
    <p>This website is about my cat friend Mirri who lives with me. 
        She is a cat of the breeds Mainecoon (75%) and Persian (25%). She was born in 2017. 
        She has been mated with a handsome Ragdoll and is expecting cubs at any moment. 
        It is so exciting and must of course be documented here.
        Cats on the internet are a popular phenomenon. Funny cat videos, cute kittens..
        ..watching cats in general are according to research good for one's well-being. 
        Since I am interested in health and also a little cat crazy, 
        I want to share Mirri's wonderful cat life. 
        So enjoy!

    <h3>Mirri's pregnancy</h3>
    <p>
        Mirri is a small cat and it is not until now at the end of her pregnancy
        that you can see that she actually has babies there under her long beautiful white fur.</p>
